# Brief
The goal is to implement a responsive inventory system you might traditionally see in a
game.
The inventory system will start by randomly populating the grid with a range of items.
A user must be able to drag and drop items between any of the slots to rearrange them as
they please. If a slot is currently occupied, the two items occupying each slot will simply
switch places. Some items will be stackable â€“ allowing a user to combine the stack of two
items of the same type.
Please follow the rules below when creating the prototype:

- Please only use the assets provided
- Please use your own original code
- Make the code modular, appropriately creating classes where required
- Avoid downloading off-the-shelf assets. e.g. From the Unity Asset Store
- Feel free to experiment with your own animations
